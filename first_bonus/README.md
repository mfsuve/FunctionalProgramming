## Question 2
 - **What does the helper function (sundays') calculate?**
 Since I send `start` and `1` as parameters to *(sundays')* function, it calculates how many Sundays fell on the first of the month, where month starts from `1`, starting from the year `start`. The year ends when year value reaches the year `end`, which is given in the upper level function *sundays1*.
